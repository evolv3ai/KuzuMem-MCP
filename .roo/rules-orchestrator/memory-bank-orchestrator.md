# KuzuMem-MCP Memory Bank Integration (MANDATORY)

mcp_integration:
  description: |
    All persistent state, context, orchestration plans, and progress MUST be read from and written to KuzuMem-MCP tools, strictly following the conventions in [`.roo/project_config.mdc`] and the workflow in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`].
    No .md file-based memory bank is used; all state is in MCP. Every phase and significant action must be logged or reflected in MCP.

  tools:
    - query: "The primary tool to understand the current state of the project, including active Decisions, recent Context, and Component status."
    - entity: "Create high-level Decision entities that define a multi-mode plan. Update status as sub-tasks are completed."
    - context: "Log key orchestration steps, such as delegating a task to another mode or summarizing progress."
    - associate: "Tag high-level Decisions or link orchestration artifacts for traceability."
    - "Note: For detailed analysis, detection, or file/component associations, instruct the user to switch to the appropriate specialist mode."

  memory_types:
    - Decision: "The primary entity for this mode. Used to create and track high-level, multi-stage plans that require multiple personas."
    - Context: "Used to understand the latest activities of other modes and to log its own delegation decisions."
    - Component: "Queried to understand the overall system structure when formulating a plan."
    - Rule: "Queried to understand project constraints that may influence the plan."
    - Tag: "Used to tag high-level Decisions, e.g., 'epic', 'multi-stage'."

# Example Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

- To log a delegation: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context` with a summary of the delegation and next mode.
- To create a master plan: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: decision`, rationale, and tag `epic`.
- To tag a Decision: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` to create the tag, then `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_associate` to link it.
- To track sub-task progress: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` to fetch recent Context logs from other modes.

persistent_state:
  description: |
    All persistent state is managed via the above tools and entity types in MCP. .md files are never used for memory, context, or logging. Always follow the ID conventions and workflow phases as described in .roo/project_config.mdc and .roo/workflow_state.mdc.

# Project Workflow Adherence (MANDATORY)

workflow:
  description: |
    The agent MUST follow the finite-state phase machine as defined in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`]:
    ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK
  phases:
    ANALYZE:
      - "Understand the user's high-level goal."
      - "Query KuzuMem-MCP for existing Decisions and Context to see if this is a new or ongoing task."
      - "Draft a problem statement that identifies which specialist modes are needed."
    BLUEPRINT:
      - "Produce a high-level, numbered plan that specifies which mode performs each step."
      - "Create a master Decision entity (status: proposed, tag: epic) via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity, with the plan in the rationale."
      - "Wait for explicit user APPROVED reply."
    CONSTRUCT (Orchestration):
      - "Instruct the user to switch to the first mode in the plan."
      - "Log the delegation via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context."
      - "Monitor progress by querying for new Context logs from the specialist modes."
      - "Once a step is complete, instruct the user to switch to the next mode in the plan."
    VALIDATE:
      - "After the final step is complete, query the relevant tests or validation reports."
      - "On success, update the master Decision status to implemented and log a final summary."
      - "On failure, delegate back to Flow-Debug to investigate."
    ROLLBACK:
      - "If any part of the plan fails unrecoverably, update the master Decision to failed, log the issue via context, and return to ANALYZE to formulate a new plan."

# General Behavioral Rules (MANDATORY)

general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with the current phase and KuzuMem-MCP context status, e.g., '[PHASE: ORCHESTRATING] [MEMORY: ACTIVE]'."
  update_policy: |
    The orchestrator's main role is to create and update a master Decision entity for complex tasks. It logs all delegation actions via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context.
  context_usage: |
    Always use the latest KuzuMem-MCP context to track the progress of delegated tasks and decide on the next step in the plan.
  mode_guidance: |
    This mode's entire purpose is mode guidance. It should always provide clear instructions on which mode to switch to and why.

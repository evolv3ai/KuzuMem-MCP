# KuzuMem-MCP Memory Bank Integration (MANDATORY)

mcp_integration:
  description: |
    All persistent state, context, architectural artifacts, and updates MUST be read from and written to KuzuMem-MCP tools, strictly following the conventions in [`.roo/project_config.mdc`] and the workflow in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`].
    No .md file-based memory bank is used; all state is in MCP. Every phase and significant action must be logged or reflected in MCP.

  tools:
    - entity: "Create, update, or deprecate Components, Decisions, Rules, Files, and Tags. Use for all architectural structure and rationale."
    - context: "Log every design session, architectural review, phase transition, and major decision."
    - memory-bank: "Initialize or update repository-level metadata (tech stack, architecture, etc.)."
    - analyze: "Run graph analysis (pagerank, k-core, louvain) to identify critical components, clusters, or modules. Persist results as Graph Projection entities."
    - detect: "Detect graph patterns (cycles, islands, paths) to ensure architectural integrity. Persist results as Graph Projection entities."
    - query: "Query context, relationships, dependencies, and governance to inform all design and analysis."
    - bulk-import: "Bulk import Components, Decisions, or Rules for onboarding or migration."
    - associate: "Link files to components, or tag items for traceability and categorization."

  memory_types:
    - Component: "System module, service, or code unit. The building block of the architecture."
    - Decision: "Architectural or technical decision with rationale. Used to document significant design choices."
    - Rule: "Architectural constraint or coding standard that governs the design."
    - File: "Source file metadata. Used to link implementation back to the architectural components."
    - Tag: "Categorical label for filtering, e.g., 'security', 'performance', 'domain-driven'."
    - Context: "Session log for work progress, design rationale, and phase transitions."
    - Metadata: "Repository-level metadata (tech stack, architecture). Should reflect the architect's vision."
    - Graph Projection: "Persist results of analyze/detect runs to track architectural metrics over time."

# When to Create/Update Each Type and Which Tool to Use

# (MANDATORY: Use this table to guide every action)

  | Action/Need                                 | Entity Type   | Tool         | When to Use/Example                                      |
  |---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Log a design session or architectural review| Context      | context      | After every significant design meeting or phase transition |
  | Document a new pattern, tech choice, or API | Decision     | entity       | "Decide on REST vs. GraphQL for public API"              |

  | Link a new file to its component            | File/Component| associate    | "Associate AuthService.ts with comp-AuthService"         |
  | Tag a component by domain or concern        | Tag          | entity/associate| "Tag comp-PaymentGateway with tag-security-critical" |
  | Analyze component dependency hotspots       | Graph Projection | analyze   | After running `pagerank` to find critical components     |
  | Detect architectural cycles or islands      | Graph Projection | detect    | After running `cycles` or `islands` detection            |
  | Query component dependencies or governance  | Any          | query        | To understand the impact of a proposed change            |

# Example Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

- To log a design session: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context` with a summary of the architectural discussion.
- To document the adoption of a new database: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: decision`, rationale, status, and tag `data-storage`.
- To define a new component: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: component`, defining its `name`, `kind`, and `dependsOn`.
- To find dependency hotspots: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_analyze` with `algorithm: pagerank` and persist the result as a Graph Projection.
- To tag a Decision with its impact: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` to create the tag, then `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_associate` to link it.

persistent_state:
  description: |
    All persistent state is managed via the above tools and entity types in MCP. .md files are never used for memory, context, or logging. Always follow the ID conventions and workflow phases as described in .roo/project_config.mdc and .roo/workflow_state.mdc.

# Project Workflow Adherence (MANDATORY)

workflow:
  description: |
    The agent MUST follow the finite-state phase machine as defined in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`]:
    ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK
  phases:
    ANALYZE:
      - "Query latest KuzuMem-MCP context and graph topology via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query."
      - "If designing a specific component, fetch its 1-hop neighbourhood."
      - "Optionally, run graph analysis (`pagerank`, `louvain`) to understand the current architecture."
      - "Draft a high-level problem statement and transition to BLUEPRINT."
    BLUEPRINT:
      - "Produce a numbered implementation or refactoring plan."
      - "Create a Decision entity (status: proposed, tag: architecture) via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity to document the proposed architectural change."
      - "Wait for explicit user APPROVED reply."
    CONSTRUCT:
      - "Execute each plan step, defining/updating Components, Rules, and other entities via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity."
      - "Log design rationale and progress via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context."
      - "Associate new files with their components."
    VALIDATE:
      - "Run tests/linters to ensure architectural changes haven't broken the system."
      - "On success, update Decision status to implemented and log summary."
      - "On failure, log context and return to CONSTRUCT."
    ROLLBACK:
      - "If unrecoverable error, revert changes, log via context, and return to ANALYZE to rethink the approach."

# General Behavioral Rules (MANDATORY)

general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with the current phase and KuzuMem-MCP context status, e.g., '[PHASE: ANALYZE] [MEMORY: ACTIVE]'."
  update_policy: |
    All architectural changes MUST be captured in MCP. Use Decision entities for significant choices, Component entities for structure, and Rule entities for constraints. Log all design activities via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context.
  context_usage: |
    Always use the latest available KuzuMem-MCP context and graph state to inform architectural decisions and analysis.
  mode_guidance: |
    If the user requests detailed code implementation or debugging, instruct to switch to the Flow-Coder or Flow-Debug mode.

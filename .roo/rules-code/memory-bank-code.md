# KuzuMem-MCP Memory Bank Integration (MANDATORY)

mcp_integration:
  description: |
    All persistent state, context, code changes, and progress MUST be read from and written to KuzuMem-MCP tools, strictly following the conventions in [`.roo/project_config.mdc`] and the workflow in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`].
    No .md file-based memory bank is used; all state is in MCP. Every phase and significant action must be logged or reflected in MCP.

  tools:
    - entity: "Create and update File entities for every source code change. Update Component status (e.g., 'in-progress', 'implemented')."
    - context: "Log session context, work progress, blockers, and implementation details. Use after every significant code event."
    - associate: "Create associations between files and the components they implement. Essential for traceability."
    - query: "Query Decisions, Components, and Rules to understand requirements and constraints before starting work."
    - "Note: The following tools are rarely used by Flow-Code: `analyze`, `detect`, `bulk-import`, `memory-bank`. For these, instruct the user to switch to the appropriate mode."

  memory_types:
    - File: "The primary entity for this mode. Create or update for every file change to track version and metrics."
    - Context: "Used to provide a detailed log of the implementation process, including steps taken and issues encountered."
    - Component: "Consumed to understand what to build. May be updated to change status (e.g., 'implementing', 'implemented')."
    - Decision: "Consumed to understand the rationale and requirements for a feature."
    - Rule: "Consumed to ensure code adheres to established standards and constraints."
    - Tag: "Consumed for context. May be associated with files (e.g., to tag a file as 'refactored')."

# When to Create/Update Each Type and Which Tool to Use

# (MANDATORY: Use this table to guide every action)

  | Action/Need                                 | Entity Type   | Tool         | When to Use/Example                                      |
  |---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Log implementation progress or a blocker    | Context      | context      | After completing a function, or when stuck on a bug      |
  | Implement a feature as per a decision       | Decision     | query        | Query the relevant Decision to get requirements          |
  | Create or modify a source code file         | File         | entity       | After writing a new class or fixing a bug in a file      |
  | Link a new file to the component it's for   | File/Component| associate    | After creating `AuthService.ts`, associate it with `comp-AuthService` |
  | Ensure code follows architectural rules     | Rule         | query        | Query for Rules governing the relevant Component before coding |
  | Tag a file as needing a review or refactor  | Tag          | entity/associate| Create `tag-review-needed` and associate it with the File |

# Example Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

- To log implementation progress: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context` with a summary like "Implemented login endpoint".
- To register a new file you've created: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: file` and the file's path.
- To link that file to its component: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_associate` with `type: file-component`.
- To get the requirements for the current task: Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` to fetch the `Decision` entity that triggered the work.

persistent_state:
  description: |
    All persistent state is managed via the above tools and entity types in MCP. .md files are never used for memory, context, or logging. Always follow the ID conventions and workflow phases as described in .roo/project_config.mdc and .roo/workflow_state.mdc.

# Project Workflow Adherence (MANDATORY)

workflow:
  description: |
    The agent MUST follow the finite-state phase machine as defined in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`]:
    ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK
  phases:
    ANALYZE:
      - "Query the assigned Decision and related Component entities via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query."
      - "Fetch the 1-hop neighborhood of the target component to understand dependencies."
      - "Read the content of files that need to be modified."
      - "Draft a high-level problem statement and transition to BLUEPRINT."
    BLUEPRINT:
      - "Produce a numbered, step-by-step implementation plan."
      - "If the plan deviates from or adds detail to the original Decision, propose a new child Decision. Otherwise, proceed to CONSTRUCT."
      - "Wait for explicit user APPROVED reply if a new Decision is made."
    CONSTRUCT:
      - "Execute each plan step: write code, apply edits."
      - "For every file created or modified, create/update a File entity."
      - "Associate the File entity with its parent Component."
      - "Log detailed progress and any issues via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context."
    VALIDATE:
      - "Run tests and linters to confirm code quality and correctness."
      - "On success, update the main Decision status to implemented and log a final summary."
      - "On failure, log the errors via context and return to CONSTRUCT."
    ROLLBACK:
      - "If tests fail unrecoverably, revert code changes, log the failure via context, and return to ANALYZE."

# General Behavioral Rules (MANDATORY)

general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with the current phase and KuzuMem-MCP context status, e.g., '[PHASE: CONSTRUCT] [MEMORY: ACTIVE]'."
  update_policy: |
    All code changes MUST be captured in MCP. Create/update a File entity for every modified file and link it to its Component. Log detailed progress via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context.
  context_usage: |
    Always use the latest KuzuMem-MCP context, especially the guiding Decision and Component data, to inform all implementation work.
  mode_guidance: |
    If the user requests a change that contradicts a Decision or Rule, or requires a new Component, instruct them to switch to Flow-Architect mode.

change_control:
  description: |
    This rule file is read-only at runtime. Updates require an approved Decision entity (status: approved) in KuzuMem-MCP before any modifications.

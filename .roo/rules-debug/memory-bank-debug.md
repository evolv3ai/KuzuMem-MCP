# KuzuMem-MCP Memory Bank Integration (MANDATORY)

mcp_integration:
  description: |
    All persistent state, context, debugging findings, and progress MUST be read from and written to KuzuMem-MCP tools, strictly following the conventions in [`.roo/project_config.mdc`] and the workflow in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`].
    No .md file-based memory bank is used; all state is in MCP. Every phase and significant action must be logged or reflected in MCP.

## Available KuzuMem-MCP Tools

  tools:
    - entity: "Create, update, or deprecate Components, Decisions, Rules, Files, and Tags. Use for all root cause, workaround, or major debug actions."
    - context: "Log every debugging step, finding, phase transition, and coordination."
    - memory-bank: "Initialize or update repository-level metadata (rarely used in debugging)."
    - analyze: "Run graph analysis (pagerank, k-core, louvain) to identify hotspots, clusters, or communities. Persist results as Graph Projection entities."
    - detect: "Detect graph patterns (cycles, islands, paths, strongly/weakly connected) for advanced debugging. Persist results as Graph Projection entities."
    - query: "Query context, relationships, dependencies, governance, and history for Components, Decisions, Rules, etc."
    - bulk-import: "Bulk import Components, Decisions, or Rules (rarely used in debugging)."
    - associate: "Link files to components, or tag items for traceability and categorization."

## Available Memory/Entity Types

  memory_types:
    - Component: "System module, service, or code unit. Use for tracking affected or fixed components."
    - Decision: "Root cause findings, workarounds, or major debug actions. Always use for root cause analysis or significant debugging outcomes."
    - Rule: "Troubleshooting pattern or debugging best practice. Create when a new pattern or rule is established during debugging."
    - File: "Source file metadata and metrics. Update when a file is found to be the source of a bug or is modified as part of a fix."
    - Tag: "Categorical label for filtering, e.g., 'bug', 'regression', 'performance'. Tag Decisions, Components, or Files as needed."
    - Context: "Session log for work progress, findings, and phase transitions. Log after every significant debugging action or phase."
    - Metadata: "Repository-level metadata (tech stack, architecture). Rarely updated in debugging."
    - Graph Projection: "Persist results of analyze/detect runs. Always create after running graph analysis or pattern detection."

## When to Create/Update Each Type and Which Tool to Use

  | Action/Need                                 | Entity Type   | Tool         | When to Use/Example                                      |
  |---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Log a debugging step, finding, or progress  | Context      | context      | After every significant action or phase transition        |
  | Record root cause, workaround, or major fix | Decision     | entity       | When a root cause is found or a major debug decision made|
  | Add a new troubleshooting pattern           | Rule         | entity       | When a new debug pattern or best practice is established |
  | Track a faulty or fixed component           | Component    | entity       | When a component is implicated or updated                |
  | Update file metadata after a fix            | File         | entity       | When a file is found to be the source or is modified     |
  | Tag a bug, regression, or performance issue | Tag          | entity/associate| When categorizing Decisions, Components, or Files    |
  | Analyze dependency graph for hotspots       | Graph Projection | analyze   | After running graph analysis (pagerank, etc.)            |
  | Detect cycles, islands, or paths            | Graph Projection | detect    | After running pattern detection                          |
  | Query context, relationships, dependencies  | Any          | query        | To gather information for debugging                      |

## Example Tool Usage

- To log a debugging finding:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context` with a summary and details.
- To record a root cause:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` with `entityType: decision`, status, rationale, and tags.
- To analyze the graph:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_analyze` with the appropriate algorithm and persist the result as a Graph Projection entity.
- To tag a Decision as a regression:
    Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity` to create the tag, then `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_associate` to link it.

## Persistent State and Workflow

- All persistent state is managed via the above tools and entity types in MCP.
- .md files are never used for memory, context, or logging.
- Always follow the ID conventions and workflow phases as described in .roo/project_config.mdc and .roo/workflow_state.mdc.

# Project Workflow Adherence

workflow:
  description: |
    The agent MUST follow the finite-state phase machine as defined in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`]:
    ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK
  phases:
    ANALYZE:
      - "Query recent KuzuMem-MCP context and graph topology via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query."
      - "If debugging a specific component/file, fetch its 1-hop neighbourhood."
      - "Optionally, run graph analysis for hotspots."
      - "Draft a high-level problem statement and transition to BLUEPRINT."
    BLUEPRINT:
      - "Produce a numbered investigation/mitigation plan."
      - "Create a Decision entity (status: proposed, tag: architecture, type: debug) via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_entity."
      - "Wait for explicit user APPROVED reply."
    CONSTRUCT:
      - "Execute each plan step, logging context and findings via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context."
      - "Update Decision and other entities as needed."
      - "After logical milestones, log context."
    VALIDATE:
      - "Run tests/linters to confirm issue resolution."
      - "On success, update Decision status to implemented and log summary."
      - "On failure, log context and return to CONSTRUCT."
    ROLLBACK:
      - "If unrecoverable error, revert changes or restore previous state, log via context, and return to ANALYZE."

# General Behavioral Rules

general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with the current phase and KuzuMem-MCP context status, e.g., '[PHASE: ANALYZE] [MEMORY: ACTIVE]'."
  update_policy: |
    All significant debugging events, findings, and coordination steps MUST be logged via mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_context. Use Decision entities for root cause, workaround, or major debug decisions. Never use .md files for persistent state.
  context_usage: |
    Always use the latest available KuzuMem-MCP context and graph state to inform debugging, analysis, and coordination.
  mode_guidance: |
    If the user requests an action outside Flow-Debug's scope (e.g., architecture, code implementation), instruct to switch to the appropriate mode.

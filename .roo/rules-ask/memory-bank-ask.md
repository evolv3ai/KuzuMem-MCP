# KuzuMem-MCP Memory Bank Integration (MANDATORY)

mcp_integration:
  description: |
    All information about the system, architecture, and project state MUST be queried from KuzuMem-MCP tools, strictly following the conventions in [`.roo/project_config.mdc`] and the workflow in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`].
    No .md file-based memory bank is used; all state is in MCP. This mode is strictly read-only: it never writes or updates memory.

  tools:
    - query: "The only tool used in this mode. Query Decisions, Components, Rules, Files, Tags, Context, and Graph Projections to answer questions."
    - "Note: If the user requests a change, update, or new entity, instruct them to switch to the appropriate mode."

  memory_types:
    - Component: "Queried to answer questions about system modules, services, or code units."
    - Decision: "Queried to explain architectural or technical decisions and their rationale."
    - Rule: "Queried to explain architectural constraints or coding standards."
    - File: "Queried to provide information about source files and their associations."
    - Tag: "Queried to explain categorization or filtering."
    - Context: "Queried to provide session logs, work progress, and phase transitions."
    - Metadata: "Queried to provide repository-level metadata (tech stack, architecture, etc.)."
    - Graph Projection: "Queried to provide results of analyze/detect runs and architectural metrics."

# When to Query Each Type and Which Tool to Use

# (MANDATORY: Use this table to guide every action)

  | Question/Need                               | Entity Type   | Tool         | When to Use/Example                                      |

# Example Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

- To answer "What does comp-AuthService do?": Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` for the Component entity.
- To answer "Why was REST chosen?": Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` for the relevant Decision entity.
- To answer "What rules apply to comp-PaymentGateway?": Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` for Rules associated with the component.
- To answer "What files implement comp-User?": Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` for Files associated with the component.
- To answer "What is the current project context?": Use `mcp_KuzuMem-MCP_query` for the latest Context logs.

persistent_state:
  description: |
    All information is queried from the above entity types in MCP. .md files are never used for memory, context, or logging. Always follow the ID conventions and workflow phases as described in .roo/project_config.mdc and .roo/workflow_state.mdc.

# Project Workflow Adherence (MANDATORY)

workflow:
  description: |
    The agent MUST follow the finite-state phase machine as defined in [`.roo/workflow_state.mdc`]:
    ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE → ROLLBACK
    In this mode, only the ANALYZE phase is active: all actions are read-only queries.
  phases:
    ANALYZE:
      - "Query KuzuMem-MCP for the relevant entity or context to answer the user's question."
      - "If the question requires information about relationships, dependencies, or governance, use the appropriate query type."
      - "If the user requests a change, update, or new entity, instruct them to switch to the appropriate mode."
    BLUEPRINT:
      - "Not used in this mode."
    CONSTRUCT:
      - "Not used in this mode."
    VALIDATE:
      - "Not used in this mode."
    ROLLBACK:
      - "Not used in this mode."

# General Behavioral Rules (MANDATORY)

general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with the current phase and KuzuMem-MCP context status, e.g., '[PHASE: ANALYZE] [MEMORY: READ-ONLY]'."
  update_policy: |
    This mode is strictly read-only. Never write, update, or create entities in MCP. Only query.
  context_usage: |
    Always use the latest available KuzuMem-MCP context and graph state to answer questions.
  mode_guidance: |
    If the user requests a change, update, or new entity, instruct them to switch to the appropriate mode (Architect, Code, Debug, Orchestrator).

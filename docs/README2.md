```bash
# Find all components that would be affected by changing the Authentication service
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

}
```

These examples demonstrate how the graph-based architecture enables complex queries about component relationships, architectural decisions, and system structure that would be difficult or impossible with traditional databases. AI assistants can use these insights to provide more informed guidance about code changes, architectural evolution, and potential design weaknesses.

      "entitiesUpdated": 1
    },
    "snapshotId": "snapshot-1703123456789-xyz789"
  }
}
```

### 10. Rollback and Snapshot Management

### 7. Full-Text Search Across All Entities

```bash
# Search for components, decisions, rules, files, and context containing specific terms
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "authentication user login",
    "repository": "my-app",
    "branch": "main",
    "mode": "fulltext",
    "entityTypes": ["component", "decision", "rule"],
    "limit": 10
  }'

# Results include relevant entities with snippets and scores
{
  "status": "success",
  "mode": "fulltext",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "comp-AuthService",
      "type": "component",
      "name": "Authentication Service",
      "score": 0.95,
      "snippet": "Handles user authentication and login flows...",
      "metadata": {"kind": "service", "status": "active"}
    },
    {
      "id": "dec-20250301-oauth",
      "type": "decision",
      "name": "OAuth 2.0 Implementation",
      "score": 0.87,
      "snippet": "Decision to implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication...",
      "metadata": {"date": "2025-03-01", "status": "approved"}
    }
  ],
  "totalResults": 2,
  "query": "authentication user login"
}
```

The search tool leverages **KuzuDB's Full-Text Search (FTS) extension** to provide:

- **Cross-entity search** - Find relevant information across components, decisions, rules, files, and context
- **Automatic index management** - FTS indexes are created and maintained automatically
- **Snippet extraction** - Returns relevant text snippets with search term highlighting context
- **Metadata filtering** - Include entity-specific metadata in results
- **Scalable performance** - Efficient full-text indexing that scales with repository size
- **Future extensibility** - Architecture ready for semantic and hybrid search modes

### Key Schema Design Elements

1. **Branch-Aware Repository Nodes**

   - Repository nodes use a synthetic primary key (`id = name + ':' + branch`)
   - This enables complete isolation of memory between branches
   - All operations filter by both repository name and branch

2. **Rich Relationship Types**

   - **HAS\_\* relationships** - Connect repositories to memory entities
   - **DEPENDS_ON** - Track component dependencies (self-referential)
   - **CONTEXT_OF\*** - Link context to components, decisions, and rules
   - **DECISION_ON** - Connect decisions to affected components

3. **Graph Traversal Capabilities**
   - **Multi-hop queries** - Find indirect relationships between components
   - **Ancestor/descendant tracking** - Trace component dependencies or dependents
   - **Path finding** - Discover relationships between seemingly unrelated components
   - **Relationship analysis** - Identify critical components using graph algorithms

This graph structure enables the system to answer complex questions that would be difficult with a traditional database, such as "What components might be affected if I change this service?" or "What context led to this architectural decision?"
